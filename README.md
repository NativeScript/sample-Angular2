# sample-Angular2
This **was** our first attempt to integrate Angular 2.0 in NativeScript. Please comment in [issue #103](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues/103)

We now recommend that you get the [TodoMVC example](https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-ng-todomvc) which integrates with the latest Angular 2 alpha releases and uses the NativeScript renderer.

# sample-Angular2
This **was** our first attempt to integrate Angular 2.0 in NativeScript. 

## Tutorials
[Building Apps with NativeScript and Angular 2](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/tutorial/ng-chapter-0)

## Samples
We now recommend that you get the [TodoMVC example](https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-ng-todomvc) which integrates with the latest Angular 2 alpha releases and uses the NativeScript renderer.

Another more complex sample with Angular is [Groceries example](https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries).
